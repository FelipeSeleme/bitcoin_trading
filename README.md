# bitcoin_trading
This was one of my first projects to learn Python. It has been discontinued. I'm working on a predictive model that 
should be committed soon.

To run, it is necessary to have an account at https://bitpreco.com, however it is possible to run the code only in simulation 
mode where it will create JSON files simulating the balances.  
  
API configuration details can be found at: <https://apidocs.bitpreco.com>.  

### bitpreco.py  
Here it is defined whether the code will run in a simulation environment or not. It also has the definitions of the 
functions that execute the buy and sell orders.  
### _sim_6.py  
Is the Python file tha will run the code with the buy and sell commands to be executed.  
### _sim_6_dev.py  
Has the definitions of the buying and selling functions in a simulation environment.
